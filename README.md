# AgriPredict

## Project Details

### What exactly does it do?

AgriPredict analyzes comprehensive climate data from NASA and localized agricultural statistics from BPS to predict the likelihood of crop failure events such as floods, droughts, and other climate-related disasters on a quarterly basis. The app provides farmers with timely alerts and actionable insights to mitigate risks and optimize crop management practices, addressing the 25% of Indonesia’s arable land currently degraded due to erosion, salinization, and nutrient depletion (Ministry of Environment, 2023).

#### How does it work?

Data Integration: Combines real-time and historical climate data from NASA’s APIs with localized agricultural data from BPS.
Temperature Increase: Incorporates data showing an average temperature rise of 1.2°C in Indonesia between 1981 and 2020 (Indonesia Meteorological Agency, 2022).
Rainfall Patterns: Utilizes information on the 15% decrease in rainy season duration in Java and Sumatra (BPS Climate Report, 2023).
Predictive Analytics: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze factors such as precipitation rate, air temperature, flood rate, humidity, soil moisture, wind speed, sunlight intensity, and soil pH to forecast potential crop failure risks.
Flood Prediction Accuracy: Machine learning models can predict flood events with 85% accuracy by analyzing meteorological and hydrological data (Smith et al., 2023).
User Interface: Presents predictions through an intuitive React-based mobile interface, incorporating Google Maps API for location-specific insights and visualizations.
Smartphone Penetration: Over 60% of Indonesian farmers own smartphones, making the app accessible to a large user base (Telecom Regulatory Authority, 2023).
Alerts and Recommendations: Sends customized notifications to farmers about upcoming weather events and provides recommendations for preventive actions.
Real-Time Processing: Utilizes cloud computing to deliver predictions in real-time, enhancing the timeliness and relevance of alerts (Tech for Good Report, 2023).
What benefits does it have?

Data-Driven Decision Making: Empowers farmers with reliable predictions, reducing dependency on intuition and mitigating the 15% decrease in farmers’ income over five years (BPS Rural Economy Report, 2023).
Risk Mitigation: Enables proactive measures to protect crops, potentially reducing annual agricultural losses of IDR 7 trillion (Ministry of Agriculture, 2023).
Enhanced Food Security: Stabilizes crop yields, contributing to a consistent food supply and reducing malnutrition rates by addressing the 7% increase (World Food Programme Indonesia, 2023).
Economic Stability: Supports farmers in maintaining steady incomes, reducing rural poverty rates by 4% and preventing a 10% increase in rural-urban migration (BPS Poverty Report, 2023; Ministry of Manpower, 2023).
Environmental Sustainability: Promotes sustainable farming practices through optimized resource management, addressing 25% soil degradation and 15% water scarcity in irrigation areas (Ministry of Environment, 2023; BPS Water Resources Report, 2023).
What do you hope to achieve?

### AgriPredict aims to enhance the resilience of Indonesian agriculture against climate change by:

Reducing Crop Failures: Anticipating adverse weather conditions to decrease crop failure rates by 30%, as evidenced by case studies in Java (Journal of Agricultural Science, 2023).
Improving Farmers’ Incomes: Helping stabilize farmers’ incomes by preventing the 15% decline seen over the past five years, thereby supporting economic stability in rural areas (BPS Rural Economy Report, 2023).
Enhancing Food Security: Contributing to a stable food supply by mitigating the 12% increase in staple food prices and reducing malnutrition rates by 7% (Indonesia Central Bureau of Statistics, 2023; World Food Programme Indonesia, 2023).
Promoting Sustainable Practices: Encouraging efficient use of resources, thereby addressing soil degradation and water scarcity, and fostering environmental conservation (Ministry of Environment, 2023; BPS Water Resources Report, 2023).
Supporting Policy and Government Initiatives: Aligning with Indonesia’s National Action Plan for Climate Change to save the government IDR 2 trillion annually in disaster response efforts (Ministry of Finance, 2023).
